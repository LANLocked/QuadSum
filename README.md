# QuadSum
QuadSum is an ESP32 application that will read input from 2 linear (quadrature signal) scales, sums the two, and produces quadrature ouput that a DRO can read. It is based heavily on FastInterruptEncoder by levkovigor

This was written in order to use multiple scales on a single axis such as the case of a milling machine with a knee and quill.
